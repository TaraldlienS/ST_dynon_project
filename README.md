# ST_dynon_project
My Dynon Interview Project

Welcome to my README for my interview project!
There are three things of note when running this C++ code

1. Have to compile using this command line: g++ dynon_ST_proj.cpp -o *choose executable name* -pthread -lrt
2. If you want the normal version only consisting of the specified format output, use the command line: ./*chosen executable name* 1
3. If you want the version with some debugging code I used (not all due to readability issues) use the command line: ./*chosen executable name* 2
4. Example of *chosen executable name* can be myProgram, myExec, IPCexample, mailSimulator, etc...
5. Not having a space/' ' followed by either 1 or 2 will result in an error (any number in that spot will run it in all honesty, but only 2 shows the extra print statements)
